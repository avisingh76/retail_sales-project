# Retail Sales Analysis  

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data with SQL and Python.  
It uses a structured dataset of transactions stored in `Retail Sales.csv`.  
The database schema and analytical queries are provided in `retail.sql`.  
Queries explore sales trends, customer insights, and product categories.  
Data cleaning steps remove nulls and prepare consistent records.  
Key analyses include revenue by category, profit margins, and AOV.  
Customer behavior is explored through repeat purchases and top spenders.  
Time-based analysis highlights busiest days, shifts, and monthly trends.  
The Jupyter Notebook (`retail.ipynb`) adds visual and statistical exploration.  
This project is useful for learning SQL analytics and retail business insights.  
It can serve as a hands-on guide for students, analysts, and data enthusiasts.
